<p>I rolled a new release of <a href="http://www.snorp.net/log/?page_id=61">daap-sharp</a> tonight, with the main new benefit being that it now runs on Windows.  After <a href="http://www.abock.org/">Aaron</a> added Bonjour bindings, there wasn&#8217;t much stopping this from happening, so I fixed up the last couple of bugs.  I also made an ultra-cheesy test <a href="http://www.snorp.net/files/DAAPBrowser.exe">application</a> using Windows Forms:<br /><br />
