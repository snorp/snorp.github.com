<p>I took some time today to update my wireless patches to latest <span class="caps">GNOME</span> <span class="caps">CVS</span>, and the latest development release of wireless-tools.  If you would like to try it, here are&nbsp;instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the latest <a href="http://www.snorp.net/files/patches/gnome_applets_jwillcox_wireless_switching_v2.tar.gz">wireless-applet</a> and <a href="http://www.snorp.net/files/patches/iwlib_jwillcox_scanning_27pre22.diff">wireless-tools</a>&nbsp;patches</li>
<li>Get the latest <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/wireless_tools.27.pre22.tar.gz">wireless-tools</a> (version 27pre22) and apply iwlib_jwillcox_scanning_27pre22.diff to it, install it,&nbsp;etc.</li>
<li>Unpack the wireless-applets patch tarball thingy in the root of the gnome-applets tree.  Apply the gnome_applets_jwillcox_wireless_v4.diff patch.  Run autogen, make,&nbsp;etc.</li>
<li>Enjoy.</li></ol>
<p>This still only works on Red Hat systems due to the usage of consolehelper.  You can fix that by putting appropriate root-getting-and-essid-setting-and-renew-dhcp-lease bits for your distro in the wireless-applet-helper&nbsp;script.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b></p>
