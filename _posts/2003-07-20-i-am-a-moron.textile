<p>I had a pretty nice week in Boston, generally.  All the Ximian guys/gals were cool (except Ian :) ).  I even managed to get some actual work done.  So, things were going well up until Friday.  That&#8217;s when I missed my plane, because I thought it was leaving on Saturday.  Ugh.  I called the travel agency, and managed to get another flight out at 6:00 AM.  I ended up getting to Indy around 11 or so.  Then, I discover that my car&#8217;s battery is dead.  Nice.  Eventually, I get a jump from the parking lot dudes, and I&#8217;m on my way.  Pretty tired by the time I get home, having not slept for about 30 hours.  Slept the rest of the day.  Have to deal with the car today, and find out what ran the battery down.  I pulled a fuse to what I thought was the culprit yesterday (there is a penny in the cigarette lighter &#8212; seems a likely cause), so we&#8217;ll see how it&nbsp;goes.</p>
