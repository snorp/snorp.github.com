<p>A month or two ago I was watching a (bogus) documentary about M. Night Shyamalan.  This was the first time I&#8217;d ever seen what he looked like, and immediately, I realized something.  I think maybe my boss is making blockbuster movies on the side.  Here is my&nbsp;proof:</p>
<div align="center">
<p><img src="http://www.snorp.net/files/photos/shyamalan-small.png" alt="shymalan"/>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.snorp.net/files/photos/naresh-small.jpg" alt="not shyamalan"/></p>
</div>
<p>Tell me those are different people.&nbsp;Seriously.</p>
