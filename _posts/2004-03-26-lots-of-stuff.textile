<p>So, haven&#8217;t blogged in a pretty long time.  Lots has happened.  Most notably, I got engaged to my long-time girlfriend, Amy!  We set the date for July.  I&#8217;m really happy!&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>Just got back from BrainShare.  It was pretty cool.  I took some pics, but I don&#8217;t have them pulled off the camera yet.  I think we were all kind of in awe about the number of Large Monkey Buttons plastered all over&nbsp;:)</p>
