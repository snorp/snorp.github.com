<p>I spent some time last night hacking up some Avahi bindings for C#, using the DBus <span class="caps">API</span>.  The wrapper is <a href="http://www.snorp.net/Server.cs">here</a>, and a little test app is <a href="http://www.snorp.net/AvahiTest.cs">here</a>.  The test app registers a &#8216;foobar&#8217; service, and then lists all services in the default (I think?) domain.  Obligatory &#8216;screenshot&#8217; below.  Unfortunately, I ran into some dbus-sharp bugs while doing this.  You&#8217;ll need <a href="http://www.snorp.net/dbus_sharp_avahi_fixes_v1.diff">this</a> patch to dbus-sharp in order to use it.  You can also grab a dll <a href="http://www.snorp.net/dbus-sharp.dll">here</a>.</p>
