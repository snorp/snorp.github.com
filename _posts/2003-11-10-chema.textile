<p>Wow, talk about some shocking news.  Chema Celorio died last night after a skydiving&nbsp;accident.</p>
<p>Chema was the person who got me involved with <span class="caps">GNOME</span>.  I saw his <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-love/2001-October/msg00008.html">post</a> to the gnome-love mailing list, and decided I wanted to help out.  He was more than willing to guide me along, often sinking quite a bit of time into answering my questions, etc.  I met him for the first time in real life this summer on my first trip to Boston after being hired.  He was staying at the company apartment in between sales trips.  One night we were bored and watched a bunch of video he had recorded from his jumps.  Chema lived life to the max, and he will certainly be&nbsp;missed.</p>
