<p>Several people have asked for a little standalone app that uses ipod-sharp, since not everyone uses Muine and keeps all of their music on their PC.  So this weekend I wrote Dopi.<br />

<p>You simply DnD folders/files onto the song list there to add stuff.  The delete key deletes (surprise!).  To try it, you&#8217;ll need the latest ipod-sharp.  It has been moved into Mono&#8217;s <a href="http://svn.myrealbox.com"><span class="caps">SVN</span></a>, so if you have the stuff from baz, that is out-of-date.  Also, ipod-sharp depends on libipoddevice in <span class="caps">GNOME</span> <span class="caps">CVS</span>, so you&#8217;ll need that too.  And lastly, Dopi itself is in my baz archive, <a href="http://www.snorp.net/bazaar/dopi--dev--0.0">here</a>.</p>
