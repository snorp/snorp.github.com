<p>I released <a href="http://www.snorp.net/log/tangerine">Tangerine</a> 0.2.6, which includes some minor bug fixes.  Also now that <a href="http://www.novell.com/products/desktop/"><span class="caps">SLED</span> 10</a> is out, I can do a screencast showing Tangerine running under it.  So I did, and you can see it <a href="http://www.snorp.net/files/screencasts/tangerine.ogg">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> It was suggested to me that a screenshot might be needed too, so here you go :)<br />
