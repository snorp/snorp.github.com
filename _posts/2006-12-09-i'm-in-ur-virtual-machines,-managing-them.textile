<p>I&#8217;ve been working on an application recently which lets you create, configure, and run VMware virtual machines (it just forks out to VMware Player for the running part).  It&#8217;s nearing usefulness now, so I thought I&#8217;d post some screenshots and&nbsp;stuff.</p>

<p>You need either qemu or vmware-vdiskmanager installed in order to create new hard disks, and it probably fails pretty badly currently if you don&#8217;t.  If I get a chance, I may write my own stuff to create the hard disks (the format is a public spec, woo!).  Anyway, you can get it from the <code>vmx-manager</code> module in gnome <span class="caps">CVS</span>.</p>
