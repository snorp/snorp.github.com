<p>This weekend I spent some more time making <a href="http://www.snorp.net/log/tangerine">Tangerine</a> work on Windows.  I built Bonjour from scratch so I could distribute the binaries, and polished up the Tangerine installer as well.  I gave it a good deal of testing, but there might be something I missed still.  The Windows version includes a plugin for finding songs automatically through <a href="http://desktop.google.com/index.html">Google Desktop</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.snorp.net/files/tangerine/TangerineSetup-0.2.6.3.exe">Download&nbsp;Now!</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I just put up a new version which fixes a bunch of issues I found.  It also adds the missing features to the config window and hopefully makes it look a little nicer.  Updated screenshot&nbsp;above.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Another updated version up with more bug fixes.  I don&#8217;t have a bug tracker set up, but if you guys hit any problems just email me (<a href="mailto:snorp@snorp.net">snorp@snorp.net</a>).</p>
